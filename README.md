In this SQL project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a tech layoffs dataset. I used SQL functions like ROW_NUMBER(), STR_TO_DATE(), and window functions to clean the data, remove duplicates, and convert dates into usable formats.

Through EDA, I uncovered key insights such as:

The top 5 companies each year with the highest layoffs

The year layoffs began and how they evolved over time

The number of employees laid off at the start of the layoff season

The data set used can be found here:-

The company stage (e.g., post-IPO, late stage) where most layoffs occurred

The industry and company responsible for the most total layoffs

This project showcases my ability to prepare real-world data for analysis and extract valuable insights using SQL.
